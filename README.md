Card Shuffling in Objective C


A small project that accomplishes the following:

1) Initializes a deck of cards based on suits and card values passed to the code
2) It then shuffles the deck using 2 shuffling algorithms.
3) Shuffling carries on if there are an repeated sequences of cards between the ;ast 2 shuffles.
4) When there are no repeated sequences the algorithm stops.
5) Analysis of run times and number of shuffles needed to achieve no repeated sequence is presented towards the end for both algorithms.
